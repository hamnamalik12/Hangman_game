# Hangman Game
## Description
    This is an updated version of the classic hangman game. I have developed this game in Python using the basic concepts and file handling techniques. 

### How to run this game?
    To run this game follow the following steps:
        1. Download or clone this game folder/repository
        2. open your terminal (anaconda or vscode)
        3. traverse to the downloaded game path
        4. run this command "python main.py"

## Rules of the game:
    To play the game keep these rules in your mind:
        1. You have to choose the category from ten given categories or just type a random it will choose for you
            {Animals, Countries, Cities, Names, Fruits, Food, Entertainment, Vegetables, Science, games}
        2. You will have 6 tries to guess the word
        3. You can guess a single letter at a time
        4. You can guess a complete word; if it's wrong it will only deduct 1 try
        5. You can guess multiple letters at once if some are right and some are wrong, the right ones will be shown, and for the  wrong one 1 try will be deducted.

## Scoring Scheme:
    It tracks all the games you have played and gives you an overall score as well.
        1. Total games played
        2. Total games won
        3. Total games lost 
        4. Average winning score

## Structure of the game: 
    You can view the game log folder to see how guessing words is done, and also refer to the flow chart that explains the whole flow of the game.
